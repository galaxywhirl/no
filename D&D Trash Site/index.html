      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>We are a group of friends who play Dungeons and Dragons whenever we have the time. We began our first campaign with "The Lost Mines of Phandelver" by Wizards of the Coast. Each of us made a character for the first time and had been slowly
        learning how to play. We still don't have a clue what we are doing, but we have a great time trying to play.</p>
      <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
      <p>Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy role-playing game designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. It has evolved over the years into a massive community with people creating their own content for the game and sharing it online. Millions of peole
        world wide play this game, both in person and online. You don't need to have game pieces to play this, only paper and your imagination.</p>
      <h2>Why Call Yourselves "Dungeons & Dorks"?</h2>
      <p>Our first Dungeon Master (aka the dice goblin) called us dorks through the whole first campaign.Eventually they re-named our groupchat Dungeons & Dorks and the name stuck.</p>
