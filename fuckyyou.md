Bandwidth is the maximum data transfer rate of a network or internet connection. It is used to measure how much data can be sent over a specific connection in an amount of time. A way of visualizing it is to think of a tube with each bit of data as a grain of sand. If you pour a large amount of sand into a small tube, it will take longer for the sand to flow through. If you pour the same amount of sand into a large tube, the sand will flow through much faster.

Bandwidth is measured in a rate expressed in bits per second. Another word for bandwidth is monthly data transfer. Web Hosting companies normally quote a monthly data transfer for a website, if the amount of data downloaded from the website exceeds its monthly limit the hosting company can shut down public access to the site.

The amount of bandwidth you need depends on what you plan on doing with your internet connection. If you only plan on using facebook and google then you could get away with a smaller bandwidth. If you plan to play videogames and stream videos you should go with a larger bandwidth.

Storage is one of the key components of a computer system with two major types, volatile storage and non-volatile storage. Volatile storage needs a constant supply of electricity to store and retain data. RAM and cache memory are examples of volatile storage.  Non-Volatile storage is a mechanism that retains digital date even when there is no  power. This is also called a secondary storage mechanism and used to permanently store data. An example of non-volatile storage is a USB.
