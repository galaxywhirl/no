        <p>This design is based off of the concept of radial symmetry.I used the
          different phases of the moon and paired it with the swirled background
          to create a symmetrical look without re-using the exact same moon
           image over and over again. Using the star in the middle of the image as
         a referencce point I create the whole image to revolve around it. </p>
        <img src="radial.png" alt="radial">
        <p>This design is based off the concept of symmetry. Using two differnt
        images of roads I sliced them in half and lined them up next to each other
        to appear as though they are heading in the same direction. I added the
      shadow people fighting as a neat little design element and to create a
    ripple in time effect. </p>
        <img src="sym.png" alt="sym">
        <p>This design is based off the concept of rhythm. I took four images and
          overlapped a differnt picture with a lower opacity over each of them so you
        can see the slight outline of the second image over the other.</p>

        <p>This design is a poster for a volunteer group who wishes to get people invloled to change the world.
        I created this design based around the concept of everyone all around the world getting
      together to help make the world a better place. I used the hands overlapping eachother
    and placed them over the earth to give a more inspiring feel to it. I wanted to show that
  everyone can work together to make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>This design was created for a design challenge with the prompt of creating a poster for
        a place no one would visit. I chose a volcanoe and had the idea to make the onkeypress="image a bit
        longer than normal to give it a feeling of being inside the volcanoe. I was going for a more funny
      and interesting to look at design. I made the little demon god dude at the bottom as part
    of my resoning as to why people should come to visit this volcanoe.</p>
