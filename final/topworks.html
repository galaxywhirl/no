        <h1>My Best Works</h1>
        <p>I created a logo for my cosplay group. I used the 3d tool in photoshop to make the text look three dimentional
        and placed an image of stars and space within the text. I had made text similar to this at the beginning of the year
      and used what I had learned from that to create this logo.</p>

        <p>I really enjoy how this design came out, I had never drawn a pathway or trees the way I did this before.
        I think the trees look really good without black outlines. I had never really made a pathway that has a horizon
      but for my first attempt I am very proud of this.</p>

                <p>This was created for the North American International Auto Show poster contest. I spent a long time working
                on this and I had never drawn a car before so I am very excited that it looked cool. I spent most of my
              time on the background city, basing it off of a real picture of the Cobo Center from accross the lake.</p>
